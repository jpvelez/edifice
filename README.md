Edifice Maps
===================

[TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) projects for maps we designed for the Reinventing Chicago Hackathon October 6-8 in Chicago.

The maps were made using data from Edifice, a database of Chicago's built environment we're assembling.

We stole the [site template](http://mapbox.com/reinventgreen/) and map styles from the wonderful folks at [Mapbox.](http://mapbox.com/).
